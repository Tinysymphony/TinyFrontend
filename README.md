####About TinyFrontend

I' becoming quit insterested in Web Frontend Develop, though the most tough point of FE is Compatibility Testing. I must acknowledge that I always consider things from the perspective of appearance rather than practicability. 

I wanna try to be a brilliant web designer of both frontend and backend. It's better late than never. All of my frontend works will be pushed here. 

On the early stage of my learning, some of them would have drawn lessons from other designers' works, some of them combines and instantiates serveral ideas. 
This period is supposed to be filled with imitation.

I'd like to design and share my own works when I'm able to express my ideas using frontend techs.
